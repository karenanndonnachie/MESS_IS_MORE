# GRBL-based machines eat 'gcode'
## G-code tools
G-code = Geometric code. This is how we get our laptops to "talk" with the drawing machines. Luckily, Inkscape (above) already comes with some neat G-code tools in the extensions menu. Andy will demonstrate how these tools work, and give you a specific walk-through for preparing drawings and type for conversion into G-code! No link needed (it's already packaged in Inkscape!)

GSender
This little piece of software helps you send the G-code to the machine. There are many G-code senders out there, but we've found this one works fairly well. It doesn't do much other than connect to a drawing machine (or other CNC device like a 3d printer) and send packets of G-code.
